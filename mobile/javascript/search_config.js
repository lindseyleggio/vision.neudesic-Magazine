WHY NOW?\nComputing is cheap, thanks to the cloud. Technol- ogy is now so inexpensive and disposable, it is em- bedded in everything—from shoes to jewelry, man- ufacturing machines to mobile phones.\nComputing is also radically more consumable than in the recent past. From website creation to basic analytics, we are in a DIY, self-service model.\nAnd last, computing is now ubiquitous. With the rise of the IoT and mobile devices, we are living and working within a digital fabric that is everywhere around us.\nDespite this fabric, roughly 70 percent of business- es have yet to begin their digital transformation. Yet, 87 percent of companies think that digital transformation will provide a competitive advan- tage. And they are right. Companies that are suc- cessful in making the digital transformation are, on average, 26% more pro table than competitors.\nWhich leaves us with work to do.\nOPERATING MODELS MUST SHIFT TO FUTURE FOCUS\nThe way that companies operate must shift. One poor customer review spreads via social media like wild re. Companies like Tesla update their prod- ucts overnight. The speed at which businesses un- derstand and react to changing business circum- stances has to radically improve. And that means the management models that they had in place for decades are going to have to transform at the same time.\n4","  Brochure Design\nHUMAN CAPITAL MATTERS MORE THAN EVER\nNothing happens without talent, right?

In the future, compa- nies will better serve customers because they are stitched into the fabric of their customers’ lives— from ideation to supply chain to delivery, more targeted outcomes will be possible.\nThe rise of platform-based eco- systems means any organization now needs a digital underpinning that goes beyond its virtual walls to include partners of all types— partners who change more fre- quently than ever. Over the next several years, many in IT leader- ship will turn to an intelligent inte- gration layer to address the issue.\n7\n“Right now, companies are rebuilding their technical foundations due to the tectonic shift of digitization. We expect this to continue at rapid pace for the next several years.”\n—David Barrett, Director of Technology, Digital Integration, Neudesic\n","TECHNOLOGY VISION\nBrochure Design   Hard wiring is going the way of the dinosaur. Infrastructures are now less tangible, instead being built on an agile software model, from APIs and cloud to microservices and bimodal IT. Citizen integrators are on the rise in most organizations. They are the heralds of change in a new digitally connected world.\nBy 2022, IoT will save consumers and businesses $1 trillion a year in maintenance, services and consumables.\n(Source: “Top Strategic Predictions for 2017 and Beyond: Surviving the Storm Winds of Digital Disruption,” Gartner, October 14, 2016)\nOrganizations need agile, scalable integration approaches that can be choreographed in real time, multiple times in a day, an hour, sometimes even a minute. The concept of “composable” in- frastructure leverages best of breed platforms and technologies to form an optimized solution. The ability to compose infrastructure on the fly is the ultimate agility in a digital world.\nEnter the digital integration platform. This intel- ligent network provides a unifying connectivity among people, applications and devices in dif- ferent locations or business units—this connec- tivity is the intelligent integration layer. It cre- ates the borderless enterprise, which includes your company, your partners, your customers, and the physical world. It is adaptive—a living, breathing organism versus the staid, fixed behe- moths of old.\n8\n","  Brochure Design\nIOT AND MOBILITY TAX TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS WHILE CITIZEN INTEGRATION SAVES THE DAY\nThe rise of smart “things” in the physical world, along with the rise of business platforms into ecosystems, creates vast volumes of data enter- ing the org., being exchanged and transformed into fuel for business results. To realize the full benefits of this scenario, the organization’s in- telligent integration layer must support this sce- nario. Many organizations are turning to cloud- based computing at the edge as a basic tool just to keep pace.\nCustomers, employees, and partners expect access to information anywhere on any device. Increasingly, business groups have larger budg- ets for technical initiatives and lead the way in technical solutions, relegating tradition-central- ized IT to a secondary role or none at all. Basic integration platforms now exist across disparate business or partner systems, creating a break from the monolithic integration approach of the past.\nAs the citizen integrator concept grows—out of sheer business necessity—and as digitization progresses, integration will become less expen- sive over time.\nIn the near future, we see some IT departments mastering the new approach to agile business, providing the tools, oversight and flexible pro- cesses to enable the business to achieve its goals without the central integration insisted upon in the past. The digital integration platform of the future requires centralized oversight versus centralized control. Adobe has done just this by gradually implementing a DIY integration strat- egy. Within the first 10 months, roughly 400 ad hoc and citizen integrators were enabled to use the company’s Hybrid Integration Platform. The result? More than 600 integration interfaces and 200+ APIs, which would have taken a centralized integration competency center years to com- plete.\nCitizen integration could save the day, if central IT can get governance frameworks right. Gartner assumes that by 2018, at least 50 percent of new integration flows will be implemented by citizen integrators. With the maelstrom of integrations that go on each day in large corporations, gov- ernance becomes an immediate priority. Em- ployees, or “citizen integrators” are empowered to “code” various pieces of infrastructure, as it relates to their goals for the customer or busi- ness. DIY integration, backed by a strong central framework, is the path forward. And that change will bring interoperability to the fore.\n(Source: ”Gartner CIO Call to Action- Shake Up Your Integration Strategy to Enable Digital Transformation”, Gartner, November 26, 2015)\n9\n","TECHNOLOGY VISION\nINTEGRATION OR\nINTEROPERABILITY?\nBoth, for the near future. Integration enables interoperability. The simple difference is that integration makes independently-designed IT elements work together while interoperabili- ty, according to Gartner, focuses more on no outstanding work remaining to get devices or software to talk to each other after they are in- tegrated. Interoperability is the goal, but most companies are a long way from it.\nBrochure Design\nBy 2020, over 20 billion connected things will be in use worldwide.\n(Source: “Gartner Says 6.4 Billion Connected” Gartner, November 10, 2015)\nA SYSTEM THAT THINKS LIKE ITS HUMAN CREATORS\nAs analytics and artificial intelligence mature, the event-driven architecture will feed informa- tion into emerging cognitive and neuromorphic computing models.

It is no longer enough to just meet customer de- sires, now companies must antici- pate them—and many serve those desires through platform-based ecosystems.\nVia just such an ecosystem, Am- azon uses analytics to recom- mend books based on a buyer’s previous likes, past purchases, shopping cart contents and what similar customers have bought. Amazon calls this “item-to-item collaborative filtering,” an algo- rithm that tailors browsing for re- turning customers.\nIn similar fashion, Netflix brings new viewing options to subscribers based on their weekend binge watching and other browsing data. The company runs the information collected through a complex algorithm to best predict future favorites.\nData has become the fuel for innovation in a digital economy that demands the new, the unanticipated, the customized.\nThe barrage of insights that businesses want to glean from Big Data, housed within the seeming limitless stores of cloud computing, has in turn fueled advances in analytics platforms. These platforms have already changed the face of many industries drastically, with large revenue spikes in data-heavy industries such as insurance, healthcare and retail. Advanced analytics has become a competitive tool embedded into the busi- ness of business.\n25\n“Over the next few years, leading organizations will link analytic initiatives firmly to financial objectives, increase investments in advanced analytics, evolve comprehensive analytics centers of excellence, and incorporate a wider range of exogenous data.”\n(Source: “Predicts 2016: Analytics Strategy” Gartner, December 11, 2015)\n","TECHNOLOGY VISION\nBrochure Design   “By 2018, decision optimization will no longer be a niche\ndiscipline; it will become a best practice in leading organizations...”\n– Gartner Predicts 2016: Advanced Analytics Are at the Beating Heart of Algorithmic Business\nIOT AND VIRTUAL REALITY\nWith 25 billion connected devices expected by 2020, the amount of data generated by then is expected to total 44 zettabytes, 10% of it from the IoT alone .

WASH is responsible for the upkeep of washers and dryers in 75,000 locations through- out the United States and Canada. Five million people do their laundry every week in a WASH laundry room.\nThe company now runs Microsoft Dynamics as part of its technology platform. “It’s not a scav- enger hunt for data anymore.

Whether mapping customer journeys or plotting a new manufacturing footprint, “data in / intelligence out” is the new mantra. To mine that intelligence, companies must use not indi- vidual data points but rather, data patterns. And Big Data is only as good as its rate of analysis. Speed matters. Because the company that pars- es the data in the most efficient, speedy way gets to innovation faster.\nInnovation centers on being able to predict what customers want before they even know it. To predict and then prescribe a “best choice” for market demand that may not even exist yet is becoming a science, thanks to analytics.\nEnter the algorithm economy. Algorithms are re- usable groupings of data-based code taking off in software development circles. Put data into an algorithm and, ideally, insight will come out the other end of that algorithm. And, the algorithm will self-learn the more it is applied. The possi- bilities for insight-as-a-service, when algorithm marketplaces combine with PaaS, continue to grow for businesses of all sizes. Evidence-based decision making is fast becoming a core compo- nent of the digital workplace.\nTHE RX FOR DIGITAL LEADERS\nBecause analytics is no longer viewed via a rear- view, “where have we been” mirror, analyzing data has become more complex. Currently, ana- lytics is real-time and already future-focused at a select few leading organizations. Combining pre- dictive modeling, business rules and scoring— among other technologies—advanced analytics is changing the face of decision management.\nOver the next few years, we see prescriptive an- alytics as an area for investment by many enter- prises, particularly because of its potential when combined with other technologies. Internally and externally, companies will capitalize on IoT sensor data and artificial intelligence not only to help them better tailor customer offers, but also to do things like reduce factory downtime and improve shipping times.\nFrom retailers customizing services for shoppers, to governments plotting the best emergency re- sponse, prescriptive analytics will contribute to an explosion of decision optimization scenari- os—changing the face of entire industries.\nCOMBINING HUMAN AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE FOR BETTER PREDICTIONS\nSan Francisco-based Stitch Fix styles clients by anticipating what would fit well with their current ward- robe and style, based on Pinterest profiles and other social data.

Neudesic implemented a predictive analyt- ics solution at the utility to accurately predict fu- ture energy demand.\nThis solution along with the predictive analytics roadmap, allows SRP executives to strategical- ly and incrementally invest at each stage of the solution development process.\nHaving the right demand forecast allows SRP to produce the right amount of power as well as balance the power grid to minimize outages and overloads.\n30\n","  Brochure Design\nTECHNOLOGY VISION AUTHORS\nTIM MARSHALL - Chief Technology O cer, Founder\nA LITTLE BIT ABOUT TIM\nAs the leader of the technology team, Tim is responsible for de ning the technological trail Neudesic blazes to em- power organizations in understanding and leveraging business solutions using the Microsoft Technology Platform.\nTim’s wealth of experience in di erent technologies, along with his extensive expertise across a wide breadth of vertical markets, enables him to assist organizations in making proper technical decisions that help them achieve their visions.
